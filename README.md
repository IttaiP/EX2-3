Answer to question:
we would need to add a function to SimpleCalculatorImpl.
In MainActivity we would need to support the button like we did to all other buttons.
we would also need to update the xml file with the design and view of the button
all the tests we previously run would stay relevant and we would add unit test to make sure the button works and flow test to make sure the flow stays correct. 
we would also hav tests like in ex2 where we check the calcualtion is done properly
